Hello,

This is my JavaScript project. I created to world's most annoying cookie consent pop-up.
I have learned; 
    - I used 'setTimeout' method to control the pop-up. 
    - I also used 'element.style' to dynamicly update an element CSS properties. 
    - I created an HTML form with input type of text and email. 
    - I used 'formData' to get data from the form as an object and then I used 'formDate.get()' method to access that data. 
    - Next, I used 'event.preventDefault' to get more control over how to submit the form. 
    - Then, I used 'row-reverse' CSS flex-box property and toggled that class on and off. 
    - With 'disabled' attribute, I blocked the users from using the close button until I wanted them to.

Happy Coding!
